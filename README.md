i3lock-blur - improved improved screen locker
===============================
This fork of i3lock adds:

- making screenshots by using -s switch ( thanks to
  https://github.com/karulont/i3lock-blur )

- blurring screenshot/image using --blur switch. Contrary to fork above
  this is performed on CPU, thus avoiding problems with drivers etc.

Original README.md
------------

i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will
see a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return
to your screen by entering your password.

Many little improvements have been made to i3lock over time:

- i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM
  (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen
   after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

- You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be
  displayed while your screen is locked.

- You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

- i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc.
  On OpenBSD i3lock uses the bsd_auth(3) framework.

Requirements
------------
- pkg-config
- libxcb
- libxcb-util
- libpam-dev
- libcairo-dev
- libxcb-xinerama
- libxcb-randr
- libev
- libx11-dev
- libx11-xcb-dev
- libxkbcommon >= 0.5.0
- libxkbcommon-x11 >= 0.5.0

Running i3lock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'i3lock' command. To get out of it, enter your password and
press enter.

On OpenBSD the `i3lock` binary needs to be setgid `auth` to call the
authentication helpers, e.g. `/usr/libexec/auth/login_passwd`.

Building i3lock
---------------
We recommend you use the provided package from your distribution. Do not build
i3lock unless you have a reason to do so.

First install the dependencies listed in requirements section, then run these
commands (might need to be adapted to your OS):
```
autoreconf --force --install

rm -rf build/
mkdir -p build && cd build/

../configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --sysconfdir=/etc \
  --disable-sanitizers

make
```

Building on Ubuntu 18.04
------------
All required packages:

`sudo apt-get install pkg-config libxcb1 libpam-dev libcairo-dev libxcb-composite0 libxcb-composite0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libev-dev libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxkbcommon0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-xkb-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-xrm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommmon-x11-dev`
